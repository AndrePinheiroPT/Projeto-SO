In the realm of angles, over seven years ago,
A problem was born, a monstrous geo show.
Zephyrcrush dreamed it, a labyrinth of lines,
Anant stared in wonder, as the challenge entwines.

Nine hours in the night, beneath a weary moon,
An elegant solution, like a hidden tune.
The hardest of puzzles, with a beauty so pure,
A statement so simple, yet few could endure.

Oh, Anant’s Geo, the treasure untamed,
A test of the ages, no solver yet claimed.
A bounty’s been placed, for the brave to bestow,
The key to unlocking Anant’s Geo.

Sent to the contests, to the great IMO,
Through hands of geometers, the legends we know.
But none cracked the enigma, no bash or pure thread,
The prize of this battle: a crown on one’s head.

Pyrrhic the victory, no rivals to fight,
An unchallenged throne in the dead of the night.
A bittersweet tale, of a problem so keen,
A masterpiece lost in the Olympiad scene.

Oh, Anant’s Geo, the treasure untamed,
A test of the ages, no solver yet claimed.
A bounty’s been placed, for the brave to bestow,
The key to unlocking Anant’s Geo.

Is there another solution, in the depths of the mind?
A spark of genius, that destiny aligned?
Synthetic or bash, who will rise to this peak?
A geometer’s grail for the bold to seek.

Oh, Anant’s Geo, the treasure untamed,
A test of the ages, no solver yet claimed.
A bounty’s been placed, for the brave to bestow,
The key to unlocking Anant’s Geo.

So gather the seekers, the dreamers, the bold,
For Anant’s great challenge, a story retold.
Through circles and tangents, may one dare to go,
To conquer the riddle of Anant’s Geo.
