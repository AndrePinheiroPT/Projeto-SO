Lines intersect the void
Mokin carves through math's cruel ploy
Ruler and compass in his hands
Shaping worlds no mind withstands

Russian winter cold and stark
He ignites the geometric spark
Polygons bowed to his lead
Hardest geos brought to their knees

Vasily tears the theorems apart
No equation twists his heart
A god of lines a king of curves
Through the angles the cosmos swerves

Hard problems no mortal could break
Mokin solves with precise stake
Infinite planes he maps and roams
Unstoppable sharp as stones

Circles cry and triangles fall
Shapes scream against his call
Beyond the stars geometry waits
Mokin answers he creates

Vasily tears the theorems apart
No equation twists his heart
A god of lines a king of curves
Through the angles the cosmos swerves
